* Strategy Name: AS001

=============================

* Trade Idea:
PMA ( Pivot Moving average) is a set of 3 EMAs on HLC3 data.

When all PMAs are rising, market is considered bullish. 
When all PMAs are falling, market is considered bearish. 
Otherwise, market is considered ranging.

It seems that PMAs of 10, 20, 30 on daily chart has predictive power.

=============================

* Buy conditions
	b1: PMA(10) is rising.
	b2: PMA(20) is rising.
    b3: PMA(30) is rising.

=============================

* Sell conditions
	s1: PMA(10) is falling.
	s2: PMA(20) is falling.
    s3: PMA(30) is falling.

=============================

* Trade Logic
	Buy IF 	(b1 AND b2 AND b3)
	Sell IF (s1 AND s2 AND s3)
